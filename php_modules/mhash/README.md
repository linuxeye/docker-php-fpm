# mhash

This is an interface to the mhash library. Mhash supports a wide variety of hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA1, GOST, and many others. For a complete list of supported hashes, refer to the constants page. The general rule is that you can access the hash algorithm from PHP with MHASH_hashname. For example, to access TIGER you use the PHP constant MHASH_TIGER.
