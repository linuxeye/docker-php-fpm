# snmp

The SNMP extension provides a very simple and easily usable toolset for managing remote devices via the Simple Network Management Protocol.

As it is a wrapper around the underlying Net-SNMP library, all basic concepts are the same and the PHP functions change their behaviour depending on the Net-SNMP configuration files and environment variables.
